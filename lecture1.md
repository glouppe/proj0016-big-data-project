# Answering a data science question

- Understanding and formalizing the problem
- Defining a model
- Collecting, cleaning and storing data
- Choosing a technology
- Analyzing the results
- Storytelling and visualization
- Iterate

---

# Understanding and formalizing

- What is it that I really want to answer?
- Why do I want an answer to this question?
- Do I understand the problem?

---

# Defining a model

- How do I answer?
- What are my assumptions?
- What statistical model do I consider?
- What algorithm shall I use?

---

# Collecting, cleaning and storing data

- What data do I need for fitting my model?
- How large this data should be?
- Where do I collect this data?
- Is data cleaning necessary?
- How do I store the data?

---

# Choosing a technology

- What technology shall I use?
- Is a laptop enough, or shall I use a large-scale distributed system?
- How do I make my analysis reproducible?

---

# Analyzing the results

- How do I analyze the results of the model?
- How do I assess the significance of the results?
- To what do I compare?
- What are the conclusions?
- Is this convincing?

---

# Storytelling and visualization

- How do I present my results?
- How do I make interpretable visualizations?

---

# Iterate

- Is this conclusive?
- Shall I go back and define a new model?
- ... or collect new/more data?
- ... or use other tools?
