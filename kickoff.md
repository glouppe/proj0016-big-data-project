- Subject expertise includes business expertise.
- Hacking + Domain expertise = danger zone. The absence of rigorous methods can beget incorrect analysis.
- There are few unicorns. Hence training in data science.

“Increasingly, scientific breakthroughs will
be powered by advanced computing
capabilities that help researchers
manipulate and explore massive
datasets.

The speed at which any given scientific
discipline advances will depend on how
well its researchers *collaborate* with one
another, and with technologists, in areas
of eScience such as **databases**,
**workflow management**, visualization,
and **cloud computing technologies**.”

# The data science pipeline

.center.width-80[![](figures/kickoff/ds-pipeline.png)]

---

class: middle

In practice, the data science process involves **several steps**:
- Understanding and formalizing the problem
- Defining a model
- Collecting, cleaning and storing data
- Choosing a technology
- Analyzing the results
- Storytelling and visualization
- Iterate

---

class: middle

## Understanding and formalizing

- What is it that I really want to answer?
- Why do I want an answer to this question?
- Do I understand the problem?

---

class: middle

## Defining a model

- How do I answer?
- What are my assumptions?
- What statistical model do I consider?
- What algorithm shall I use?

---

class: middle

## Collecting, cleaning and storing data

- What data do I need for fitting my model?
- How large this data should be?
- Where do I collect this data?
- Is data cleaning necessary?
- How do I store the data?

---

class: middle

## Choosing a technology

- What tools do I need?
- What technology shall I use?
- Is a laptop enough, or shall I use a large-scale distributed system?
- How do I make my analysis reproducible?

---

class: middle

## Analyzing the results

- How do I analyze the results of the model?
- How do I assess the significance of the results?
- To what do I compare?
- What are the conclusions?
- Is this convincing?
- Does this corroborate with previous studies or intuition?

---

class: middle

## Storytelling and visualization

- How do I present my results?
- How do I make interpretable visualizations?
- How do I present my results to a non-technical audience?
- How do I make my results and conclusions as simple as possible, but not simpler?

---


class: middle

## Iterate, iterate, iterate

- Is this conclusive?
- Am I going in the right direction?
- Shall I go back and define a new model?
- ... or collect new or more data?
- ... or use other tools?

# Groups

The project is carried out in **groups of 3 students**.

The topic should be selected and the groups should be formed by October 8.
- Notify us by email.
- If you are alone, send us an email too!

---

# Reviews

We will meet on *every last Monday of the month* to review your progress.
- Oral presentation of your ongoing progress.
    - 10mn
    - Q&A
    - Everyone must present at least once
- Short report
    - 4 pages max
    - To be submitted on the Friday before the review day

The goal is to give you feedback on technical progress and project management.

---

# Seminars

The project is complemented by seminars by local and external speakers.
- Topics: big data, data science, visualization, communication, domain-specific presentations, etc.
- Presence at the seminars and intermediate reviews is **mandatory**.

---

# Final defense

The final deliverables of your project consist in:
- a final comprehensive report of your study
- a (public) oral defense

---

# Agenda

- 24/09/2018 (2PM) Kick-off
- 08/10/2018 Groups must be formed and the topic decided
- 29/10/2018 (2PM) Project review #1: Pre-analysis, literature review
- 26/11/2018 (2PM) Project review #2: Data collection #1
- 17/12/2018 (2PM) Project review #3: Data analysis #1
- 25/02/2019 (9AM) Project review #4: Data collection #2
- 25/03/2018 (9AM) Project review #5: Data analysis #2
- 29/04/2018 (9AM) Project review #6: Further improvements.
- 13/05/2018 (9AM) Project defense and final report

# Evaluation

The evaluation will be based on:
- the intermediate review meetings (progress achieved, quality of project management) (*6x 5%*)
- the quality of the final report (*15%*)
- the quality of the final oral defense (*15%*)
- the overall study (*40%*)
    - the originality, methodology, clarity, reproducibility and technological choices of the solution will be mainly assessed.
