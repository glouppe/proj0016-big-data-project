- Subject expertise includes business expertise.
- Hacking + Domain expertise = danger zone. The absence of rigorous methods can beget incorrect analysis.
- There are few unicorns. Hence training in data science.

## Understanding and formulating the problem

- What is it that I really want to answer?
- Why do I want an answer to this question?
- Do I understand the problem?
- What is the hypothesis that I want to evaluate?

---

class: middle

## Collecting, cleaning and storing data

- What data do I need?
- How large this data should be?
- Where do I collect this data?
- Do I have to run an experiment to collect data?
- Is data cleaning necessary?
- How do I store the data?

---

class: middle

## Exploring the data

- How does the data look like?
- What are summary statistics?
- Does this look consistent?

---

class: middle

## Analyzing the data

- What statistical models should I consider?
- How do I analyze the results of the model?
- How do I assess the significance of the results?
- How do I validate my hypothesis?
- To what do I compare?
- What are the conclusions?
- Is this convincing?
- Am I confident about these results?
- Does this corroborate with previous studies or intuition?

---

class: middle

## Storytelling and visualization

- How do I present my results?
- How do I make interpretable visualizations?
- How do I present my results to a non-technical audience?
- How do I make my results and conclusions as simple as possible, but not simpler?

---


class: middle

## Iterate, iterate, iterate

- Is this conclusive?
- Am I going in the right direction?
- Shall I go back and define a new model?
- ... or collect new or more data?
- ... or use other tools?

---

class: middle

## Choosing a technology

- What tools do I need?
- What technology shall I use?
- Is a laptop enough, or shall I use a large-scale distributed system?
- How do I make my analysis reproducible?

# Seminars and tutorials

The project is complemented by seminars and tutorials by local and external speakers.
- Topics: big data, data science, visualization, communication, domain-specific presentations, etc.
- Presence at the seminars and intermediate reviews is **mandatory**.

---

# Groups

The project is carried out in *groups of 3 students*.

---

# Reviews

We will meet on *every last Monday of the month* to review your progress.

- Oral presentation of your ongoing progress.
    - 10mn
    - Q&A
    - Everyone must present at least once
- Short report
    - 4 pages max
    - To be submitted on the Thursday before the review day.
- The agenda for the reviews will be announced together with the project proposals.
- The goal is to give you feedback on technical progress and project management.



---


# Final deliverables

The final deliverables of your project should consist in:
- a final comprehensive report of your study;
- reproducible scripts for the collection, analysis and visualization of your data;
- a defense of your project.

---

# Evaluation

The evaluation will be based on:
- the intermediate review meetings (progress achieved, quality of project management) (*30%*)
- the quality of the final report (*15%*)
- the quality of the final oral defense (*15%*)
- the overall study (*40%*)
    - the originality, methodology, clarity, reproducibility and technological choices of the solution will be mainly assessed.

We will notify your score individually after each intermediate review stage.

---

class: middle

## Regularization

- Absence of a group at a review: 0 to this review for the group.
- Delay in submitting a report: -1% per day.
- Absence of a group member at a review: individual 0 for the review.
- Absence of a group member at a seminar: individual -5% on the total of the year.

---

class: middle

## How to report

- One of the outcomes of the project is to learn how to communicate / report orally and in written form.
- You have to be on time so that we can provide feedback : reports on Thursday 23:59 before review. **Hard deadline!**
- Create your own template and always use the same for the intermediate review stages.
    - If you make incremental reports, make sure you highlight what is new.
    - If not, introduce a status of your past reports at the beginning.
- Use a strict methodology: follow the steps of slide 16.
    - briefly report what you did for each step.
    - provide approximate percentage of completion for each step.
- Identify which group member is responsible for what.
- For oral presentations, stick to the allocated time slot.

---

class: middle

## How to work efficiently

- Make small iterations first but try to go/project over all the steps.
- Write what you do. It will help you being on time for your reports.
- Share the work between group members and give precise responsibilities.
    - Make use of collaborative tools! (e.g., Github, Gitlab, Trello, etc)
